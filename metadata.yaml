description: '"Agnes Blakiston did not want to rent the old parsonage from Miss Emily
  Benton and soon came to regret it. At night the phone would ring and there would
  be unseen visitors. Was the house haunted? And did Miss Emily have a secret so terrible
  she would rather die than reveal it?"-Cover p. [4].'
